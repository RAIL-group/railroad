Visualization for the plots:
- [ ] Right now, I have an annotation for each of the cases that gives detail, but perhaps it would be best to just let the axis label spill over into the plot itself (avoiding any line wrapping). I'll need to move the axis labels up a bit to make sure they don't fully cover the plots.
- [ ] I need to put the failed runs separately. Red 'x' on the rightmost part of the plot.
